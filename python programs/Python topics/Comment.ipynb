    "# what is Comment in Python?\n",
    "# A comment in Python is a line or a part of a line that is not executed as part of the program.\n",
    "# Comments are used to explain the code, make it more readable, and provide context for other developers (or for yourself in the future).\n",
    "# In Python, comments are created using the hash symbol (#). Anything following the # on that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter. \n",
    "# There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments.\n",
    "# Single-line comments:\n",
    "# These comments occupy a single line and start with the # symbol.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This comment explains that the line prints a greeting message\n",
    "# Multi-line comments:\n",
    "# Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments like some other programming languages.\n",
    "# However, you can create multi-line comments by using consecutive single-line comments or by using triple quotes (''' or \"\"\").\n",
    "# Example using consecutive single-line comments:\n",
    "# This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "# that spans multiple lines"
